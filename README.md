**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Hardware Setup

Lidar Sensor -> Wipy1 -> WLAN -> RaspBerry Pi -> WLAN -> Wipy2 -> Dotstar LED Strip

## Getting started

- make sure you are on python 3.4+
- clone this repository
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- create a invoke.yaml configuration (see invoke.sample)
- deploy to sensor and actor Wipy devices with `invoke lidar deploy` and `invoke dotstar deploy`
